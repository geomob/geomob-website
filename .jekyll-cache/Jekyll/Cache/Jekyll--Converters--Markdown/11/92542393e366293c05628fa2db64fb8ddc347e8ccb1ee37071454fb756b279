I"†<p>Fellow geomobsters,</p>

<p>Iâ€™m pleased to reveal the details of our first #geomob of 2016. Weâ€™ll meet at 18:30 on Thursday the 21st of January in room G07 of UCLâ€™s Chadwick Building. A map can be found over <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob/">on the lanyard page for the evening</a>, where we also ask that you sign up so we can get an idea of the numbers.Â </p>

<p>It will be our first event of the new year, but rest assured we will be sticking to our time honored formula: we will have six speakers, each of whom will present for 10-15 minutes. After each speaker there will be a few minutes for audience questions.Â </p>

<p>Our lineup for the evening kicks off with two speakers who had hoped to join us at the last event but then unfortunately had to cancel:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/charliedavi">Charlie Davies</a> of <a href="http://www.igeolise.com/">iGeolise</a> will share what they are up to</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/abdulrshahid">Abdul Shahid</a> will report on some of his research into crowd sourced mapping</li>
</ul>

<p>then</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/cpina">Carles Pina</a> will tell us about <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/benches/id962734704?mt=8">Benches App</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/giacecco">Gianfranco Cecconi</a> will present <a href="http://www.digitalcontraptionsimaginarium.co.uk/">one of his many open data projects</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/SpatialRed">Denise McKenzie</a>Â will talk about <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">the OGC</a></li>
</ul>

<p>and finally</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/brtknr">Bharat Kunwar</a> of the University of Bristol will discuss his research in toÂ <a href="https://twitter.com/MassEvac">establishing evacuation friendliness of world cities using OpenStreetMap, open data, ABM, and Python</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to all the speakers for taking the time to share their projects.</p>

<p>After the talks ,weâ€™ll quickly vote by show of hands for the SplashMaps best speaker prize, and then, as per long-standing #geomob tradition, adjourn to a nearby pub for discussion and #geobeers. Many thanks to our sponsors for making the drinks possible, and a special thanks to UCL for once again providing a venue to us at no cost. Without such generous support #geomob would not be possible, please get in touch if your brand would like to <a href="http://geomobldn.org/sponsorship">become a sponsor</a>.Â </p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you all at 18:30 on Thursday the 21st of January. For those looking to get ahead on filling in their 2016 diary, our next event after the January #geomob <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-march/">will be Tuesday, March 15th</a>. We have a few speakers already committed, but would also welcome a few more volunteers.Â </p>

<p>See you in 2016,</p>
