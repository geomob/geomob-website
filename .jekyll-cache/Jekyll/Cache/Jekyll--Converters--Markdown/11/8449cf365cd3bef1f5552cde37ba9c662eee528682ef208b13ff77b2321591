I"'<p>Hail fellow geomobsters!</p>

<p>In just over a month, on Tuesday the 18th of March, we’ll be gathering once again to celebrate geoinnovation in any and all forms. We return to <a href="http://www.campuslondon.com/">Campus</a>, Google’s co-working/events space near Old Street. A map and all details can be found over on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-march/">the Lanyrd page for the evening</a>, where we also ask that you sign up so we can get an idea of numbers.</p>

<p>The evening will kick off at 18:30, please be on time as we are fortunate to have a great lineup of speakers to get through before the obligatory post-event geobeers. As always, each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to share their work and then there will be a few minutes for questions from the audience. </p>

<p>Our lineup on the 18th:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In what will no doubt be a feast for the eyes, <a href="http://www.jasondavies.com/">Jason Davies</a> has finally been persuaded to show off some of his D3 geo magic.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/EmilLondon">Emil</a> of <a href="http://citymapper.com/">CityMapper</a> will update us on their progress as they help the world get from A to B.</li>
  <li>Tubefreaks will get their fix as <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/peterblloyd">Peter Lloyd</a> will tell us about the evolution of the New York City subway map. </li>
  <li>Start-up <a href="http://www.lemonllc.com">LEMON</a> will talk us through their spin on location based services. </li>
  <li>Andy Ashburner will tell us about his app <a href="http://www.pindropapp.com/">Pin Drop</a>. </li>
  <li>Finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/geoviews">Benjamin Hennig</a> of Oxford’s <a href="http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/bhennig.html">School of Geography and Environment</a> will share with us one of his many interesting projects around spatial data analysis and data-visualization</li>
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to all of the speakers for their time and volunteering to speak. As ever, we’re every thankful to our sponsors - K<a href="http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">nowWhere Consulting</a>, <a href="http://www.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data</a>, and <a href="http://www.splashmaps.net/">SplashMaps</a> for making the post talk geobeers happen. In the start of a new tradition, the audience will vote on best speaker and the winner will receive a <a href="http://www.splashmaps.net/shop/make-map/">personalised SplashMap</a>.</p>

<p>If you unfortunately can’t make it on the 18th, or even if you can - please put our 13th of May event in the diary. <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-may/">The Lanyrd page</a> is here, we will be back at UCL and the evening has the makings of a great one as we already have several intriguing  speakers. Please send suggestions if you know of anyone who should speak at a future event. </p>
