<p>Friends,</p>

<p>as the year winds down I want to take the chance to say thank you the various 
venues that host #geomob. Without these partners making their facilities 
available to us our events would simply not be possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://geovation.uk" class="center-image"><img src="/images/geovation.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p>First up, we have <a href="https://geovation.uk/">Geovation</a>, a start-up accelerator 
based in Clerkenwell. Sponsored by the Ordnance Survey and the UK Land 
Registry, Geovation provides start-ups with grant funding, hands-on assistance, 
and office space. Over the years many different Geovation start-ups have 
spoken at #geomob, and indeed Geovation alumni <a href="/post/flock-sponsors-geomob">Flock has even gone on to be a #geomob sponsor</a>.</p>

<p>I strongly encourage anyone in London thinking of doing a location-based<br />
or proptech start-up to investigate Geovation’s compelling offering.</p>

<p>Our next #geomob - <a href="/post/jan-16th-2019-geomob-details">on 16th Jan, 2019</a> - 
will be at Geovation.</p>

<p>Next, we need to thank UCL’s Geography Department, and especially 
<a href="https://twitter.com/mhaklay">Prof. Muki Hakley</a> for hosting #geomob too many 
times to count over the years. UCL is where OpenStreetMap was 
invented, and it is great that by having #geomob there we can do a small part 
to carry on the tradition of geo-innovaton. Many long-standing members of
the #geomob community have connections to UCL in one form or another, but 
it’s also always nice to invite the next generation of students into our 
community as well.</p>

<p>Last, but by no means least, we’re fotunate to benefit from the generosity of 
the <a href="https://www.bcs.org">British Computing Society (BCS)</a> who occasionally 
host us at their excellent Covent Garden facility. We’re very appreciative of 
the long-standing support of this well respected industry body as a basis for 
our geo-experimentation.</p>

<p>Thank you to all of our venue sponsors for making #geomob possible.</p>

<p>And to all 
<a href="/sponsorship">sponsors</a>, 
<a href="/past-speakers">speakers</a>, and 
attendees for helping create #geomob as a forum for geo-innovation.</p>

<p>I look forward to seeing you all in 2019,</p>
