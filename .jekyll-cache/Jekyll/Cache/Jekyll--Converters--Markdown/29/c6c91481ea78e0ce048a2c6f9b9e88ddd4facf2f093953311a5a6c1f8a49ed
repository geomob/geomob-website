<p>Hello geomobsters,</p>

<p>the first #geomob of 2015 will take place on the 13th of January at 18:30. Our old friends at UCL have generously agreed to have us back, this time weâ€™ll be in the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/venues/london/vdykh/">Gavin de Beer lecture theatre in the Anatomy building</a>. If youâ€™ll be attending please sign up <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob/">on the lanyrd page</a> so we have a sense of the numbers to expect.</p>

<p>The evening looks to be our best one yet - I have said that before, but this lineup looks even better! We have a great mix of six diverse geo topics.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/sciremotesense">Robin Wilson</a> will discuss his work digitising the John Snow cholera map.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/peterkwells">Peter Wells</a> will tell us about the Open Addresses project</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/basil">Basil Safwat</a> will present <a href="http://www.telescopecards.com/">Telescope Cards</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/maxgadney">Max Gadney</a> will show off <a href="http://www.aftertheflood.co/">After the Flood</a>â€™s London Squared map</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/ianhamilton_">Ian Hamilton</a> will present an accessible tube map</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/DougSpecht">Doug Specht</a> will talk aboutÂ â€Using GIS to legitimize User Generated Content (UGC) in human rights advocacyâ€</li>
</ul>

<p><span>As always each speaker will have maximum 15 minutes (we may go slightly longer for the game), and then a few minutes of audience questions.Â </span><span>After all that weâ€™ll vote for the best speaker and head to a nearby pub forÂ </span>discussion<span>.Â </span></p>

<p>Many thanks to all who attended last weekâ€™s <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/98001859550/lineup-and-details-for-the-nov-4th-geomob">November #geomob</a>, and a special congrats to <a href="https://twitter.com/robhawkes">Robin Hawkes</a>, who won the SplashMaps best speaker prize for his talk on the Vizicities building height tagger.Â </p>

<p>Until then I wish all of you a great holiday season and a strong start to 2015. Hopefully Santa will leave an atlas, a SplashMap, a new GPS device, or similar under your tree.Â No doubt there will be a London OpenStreetMap Christmas gathering, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/London">details will appear here</a>, and I hope to see you all there. Â </p>

<p>For those who canâ€™t make it in January, we look forward to seeing you at the March 19th #geomob (<a href="http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-march/">sign up here</a>). I welcome all speaker volunteers/suggestions.Â </p>

<p>Happy holidays and see you on the 13th of January at 18:30,</p>
