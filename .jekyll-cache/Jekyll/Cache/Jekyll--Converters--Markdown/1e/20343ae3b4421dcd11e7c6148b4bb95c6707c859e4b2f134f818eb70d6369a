<div class="heading">When and where?</div>
<p>The next #geomobBCN will be at
<span class="b">18:00 on Wednesday, the 2nd of October</span>.
I am delighted that we can once again rely on the hospitality of our friends at
<a href="https://coworkidea.com/en/">CoWorkIdea</a>, who will host us at their
excellent co-working space at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/wEAX4uRU8EN2">Carrer de Torres i Amat, 21, First Floor</a>.</p>

<div class="heading">Why?</div>

<p>The goal of Geomob is to provide a forum to learn and exchange ideas about any
interesting services and projects that deal with location. Everyone working in
or curious about the location space or with location services is welcome. You
absolutely do not need to be some sort of GIS expert (though GIS experts are
of course welcome as well).</p>

<p>The talks are a chance to learn, but equally important is the dialogue between
the attendees, which is why I hope everyone can also stay for #geobeers -
generously paid for by our sponsors - at a nearby bar after the talks.</p>

<p>Geomob would not be possible without speakers and sponsors.
Over the years we have had so many fantastic talks, spanning the range from
inspirational to informative to weird and wacky. See the list of
<a href="/past-speakers">all the past speakers</a>. Please get in touch if you would like
to speak at a future geomob.</p>
