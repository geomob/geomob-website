I"W<p>Happy New Year geomobbsters!</p>

<p>We have several announcements to make as we kick of the 2013 #geomob season.</p>

<p>First of all we’re very pleased to announce that the <a href="http://www.agi.org.uk/">Association for Geographic Information</a> (more commenly known as “the AGI”), is joining us as an ongoing promotional sponsor. We look forward to welcoming AGI members at all future #geomob events.</p>

<p>Continueing on the theme of sponsorship we have more good news, November’s sponsor <a href="http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">Knowwhere consulting</a> is returning to help us with our February event. Along with permanent sponsor Lokku Ltd, makers of <a href="http://www.nestoria.com/">property search engine Nestoria</a>, we now have a solid basis to ensure #geomob remains an informative and enjoyable (and thirst quenching!) event. </p>

<p>Of course the final piece in the sponsorship puzzle is our locaiton sponsors who donate their facilities. Our first event of 2013 will take place on Thurday the 7th of Februray at 18:30 and we’re very fortunate to be invited back to the <a href="http://www.bcs.org">British Computing Society</a>’s excellent facilities near Covent Garden (<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.5108&amp;mlon=-0.1218&amp;zoom=18&amp;layers=M">The Davidson Building, 5 Southampton Street London, WC2E 7HA</a> to be precise).</p>
