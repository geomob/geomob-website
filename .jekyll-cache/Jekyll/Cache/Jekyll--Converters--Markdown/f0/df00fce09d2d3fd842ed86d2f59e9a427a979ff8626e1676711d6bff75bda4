<p>The next #geomob will be at 18:30 on the 6th of June, 2018. Our good friends 
at UCL have once again made their facilities available to us, we will be 
<strong>in <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps/chadwick-building">the Chadwick Building</a>, room B05</strong>. Many thanks to them, without such generosity #geomob would not be possible.</p>

<p>Our format will be the same as ever: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory. Then we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our generous sponsors:Â <a href="https://carto.com">CARTO</a>, <a href="http://what3words.com/">What3Words</a>, <a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data</a>, <a href="https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">KnowWhere Consulting</a>, and <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a>.</p>
