I"<p>If you miss geo talks why don’t you check out this <a href="http://twitter.com/mhaklay/status/40088588167286784">talk</a>? It’s organised by <a href="http://twitter.com/mhaklay">Muki Haklay</a> (Senior lecturer in GIS at UCL) and features the team behind the <a href="http://www.noisetube.net/">NoiseTube</a>, an application that turns mobile phones into environmental data monitors.</p>

<p>We would also like to thank Muki Haklay and Ollie O’brien and everyone else in UCL for hosting us at our next Geomob event on <strong>Thursday, 12th of May</strong>.</p>
