I"ö<p>Many thanks to everyone who came out for <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/154396358235/first-geomob-of-2017-25th-jan-at-new-venue">the first #geomob of 2017</a> last week.</p>

<p>It was a strong turnout and good talks. A special thanks goes out to our new hosts <a href="http://thetrampery.com/workspaces/traveltech-lab/">Traveltech Lab</a> for their amazing venue. Anyone doing a start-up in the travel space in London should check them out. Iâ€™m hopeful weâ€™ll be back there later in the year. Many thanks to all the speakers and a specialÂ congrats to SplashMaps best speaker prize winner <a href="https://twitter.com/mikejthompson">Mike Thompson</a> for his talk about<br />
<a href="http://admissionsday.co.uk/">AdmissionsDay</a>.</p>

<p>Looking forward, our next event at 18:30 on the evening of Wednesday the 29th of March weâ€™ll be with our friends at <a href="https://geovation.uk/hub/">Geovation</a> in Clerkenwell (1 Sekforde Street, EC1R 0BE, or <a href="http://w3w.co/pushed.kinks.battle">pushed.kinks.battle</a>)Â Weâ€™ve been fortunate to host #geomob there before, it is an excellent location. Many thanks to them for having us back.</p>

<p>No change to our tried and true format - each speaker will have 10-15 minutes toÂ present their project, theyâ€™ll then face a few minutes of questions from theÂ audience, and at the end weâ€™ll select a best speaker before heading to a nearbyÂ pub for discussion over goobers generously made possible by our sponsors <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a>, <a href="http://what3words.com/">What3Words</a>, <a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data</a>, and <a href="http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">KnowWhere Consulting</a>. If your company is interested in sponsoring <a href="http://geomobldn.org/sponsorship">please get in touch</a>.Â </p>
