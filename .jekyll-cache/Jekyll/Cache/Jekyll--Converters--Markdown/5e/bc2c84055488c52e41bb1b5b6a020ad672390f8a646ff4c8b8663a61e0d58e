<p>As always a diverse mix of topics from across the spectrum of geo-innovation. Weâ€™ll be back at Googleâ€™s Campus near Old Street, a map can be found on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-july/">the lanyrd page for the evening</a>, where you should also please sign up. In terms of format, there will be no deviation from tried and true tradition. Each speaker will share his or her material for 10-15 minutes, there will be questions from the audience, and at the end of the evening we will will vote by show of hands on the best speaker who will receive <a href="http://www.splashmaps.net/shop/make-map/">a custom SplashMap</a>. Afterwards we will all head to the pub.Â </p>

<p>And on that note, congratulation to Andrew Brown (in photo below) of <a href="http://tourso.me/">Toursome</a> who won the best speaker prize at last weekâ€™s #geomob.Â </p>
