I"Ò<p>Fellow geoenthusiasts,</p>

<p>Iâ€™m delighted to write that <a href="http://www.esriuk.com/">Esri UK</a> has joined the #geomob family as our newest sponsor. If you work in geo you are familiar with Esri, the worldâ€™s leading supplier of GIS software. Their sponsorship is a great endorsement of the #geomob community, and perfectly matches our desire to be the meet up for anyone in London doing anything innovative in geo, be it for fun or profit, be they a hobbyist, a start-up, academic, or a globally known geo brand. Â </p>

<p>Of particular interest to the #geomob crew might be the Â <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/en/startups/">EsriÂ Startup Program</a>, which is a three year program to help emerging businesses. Please check it out.</p>

<p>Past #geomob speaker and Esri UK developer evangelist <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesLMilner">James Milner</a> will be on hand at our next event (<a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/120609751325/july-15th-geomob-lineup">at 18:30 July 15th at the BCS, see you there</a>), to answer any and all Esri questions, and hopefully there will also be a strong turn out from his colleagues. If thatâ€™s just too long to wait I encourage you to start following <a href="https://twitter.com/esriuk">@esriuk</a> on twitter to learn more.Â </p>

<p>Please join me in thanking Esri UK and all of our sponsors for their generosity. It is only through their support that #geomob is possible. If your brand is interesting in sponsoring #geomob, please get in touch.</p>

<p>Thank you, and I look forward to seeing you all on the 15th,</p>
