I"R<p>Friends,</p>

<p>it’s hard to believe, but we’re almost to the end of 2016. Many thanks to all of you for another great #geomob year.</p>

<p>Turning our attention to 2017 our first event will take place at 18:30 on Wednesday the 25th of January. I’m pleased to announce we’ll be at a new venue. <a href="http://thetrampery.com/workspaces/traveltech-lab/">Traveltech Lab</a> has generously agreed to host us! They’re at <a href="http://osm.org/go/euu6Ajdnz-?m=">6th Floor,<br />
2 More London Riverside, London SE1 2RR</a>. I am told the view over the river and towards Tower Bridge is amazing. The nearest tube is London Bridge. Please <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2017/geomob/">sign up on the Lanyrd page</a> (if possible, sadly it seems the service has become unreliable) so we have a sense of the numbers. </p>

<p>Many thanks to Traveltech Lab for volunteering their space. As a travel incubator we’ll hopefully be hearing from their start-ups at #geomobs in the future.</p>

<p>Despite the new venue, we will follow the same tried and true format from the past. Five speakers have volunteered to share their projects with us. After a very brief introduction each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to discuss their project, then take a few questions. At the end of the evening we’ll vote for the SplashMaps best speaker and then retire to a nearby pub for discussion. </p>

<p>Our speakers for the evening are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/edleonklinger">Ed Leon Klinger</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://www.flyflock.io/">Flock</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/mikejthompson">Mike Thompson</a>, creator of <a href="http://admissionsday.co.uk/">AdmissionsDay</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/johnbfagan">John Fagan</a> will talk to us about mobile location context.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/SamHillDesign">Sam Hill</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://www.runanempire.com/">Run an Empire</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/HertsWestUK">Sean McGee</a> will show off his “What are you looking at” App</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you agree it looks like a great line-up. </p>
