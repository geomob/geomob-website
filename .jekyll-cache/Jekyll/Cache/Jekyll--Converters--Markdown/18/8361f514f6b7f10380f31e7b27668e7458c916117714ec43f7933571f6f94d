<p><strong>Who should attend?</strong></p>

<p>Geomob is a community of academics, developers, industry professionals and enthusiasts who are passionate about location data driven products and businesses in Munich and beyond.</p>

<p>We seek to create a group of diverse participants and speakers. The goal for all of us is to better understand how location data and the technology around it affects all aspects of development.</p>

<p>Geomob is for everyone interested in geospatial technology - be it mobility, location intelligence, computer vision, indoor mapping, navigation, drone, GIS or any other location data driven industry.</p>

<p>We aim to meet every two or three months, providing a relaxed forum to discuss geoinnovation, whether its for fun or profit.</p>

<p>Please come along to learn more about location technology and discover what we can do to shape the future of the industry together.</p>
