Steven catchs up with old friend, colleague, former Geomob London speaker, and chair of OSGeo:UK <a href="https://twitter.com/archaeogeek">Jo Cook</a>. They talk about Jo's background and introduction to geo via archeology, her eventual path to open source software and OSGeo:UK. She shares the story behind the Portable GIS project, and they discuss the importance of documentation, not just for programmers, but as a way for people with limited technical skills to also contribute to open source. Enjoy.
