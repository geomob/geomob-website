I"\<p>Many thanks to everyone who came to <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/62323396116/autumn-geomob-tuesday-29th-of-october-at-ucl">last night’s event</a>. It was one of our best geomobs yet, with six great speakers and a large audience of regulars and also many new faces. As always many thanks to the great folks at UCL who made a venue available for us. </p>

<p>Our little gathering has grown in popularity, evidence of which is that we are now being bombarded with volunteers to speak. It’s likely that in 2014 we will aim to have an event every two months rather than every three, but we will stick to our tried and true formula of brief talks featuring a healthy mix of start-ups, academics, big companies, and geodreamers, all of course washed down with #geobeers. All of this is made possibly by the generous support of our sponsors: <a href="http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">Knowwhere Consulting</a> and <a href="http://www.opencagedata.com">OpenCage Data</a>. We are always on the hunt for more sponsors, if your company might be interested please contact us via the @geomob twitter account. </p>

<p>In this spirit, I am delighted to announce that we already have a great line up set for our next event. The first geomob of 2014 will be on Tuesday the 14th of January at 18:30. We are very fortunate that <a href="http://www.bcs.org/">the BCS</a> has invited us back to their excellent venue facilities near Covent Garden, for an exact address and map please see <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob/">the Lanyrd page for the event</a>, where you should also sign up so that we have an estimate of numbers. </p>
