<p>Our final #geomob event of 2017 will be on the evening of Wednesday, 25th October. Our friends at <a href="https://geovation.uk/hub/">Geovation Hub</a> have once again made their excellent facility available to us. Doors open at 18:00 and the talks will start at 18:30. We extend a special welcome to everyone from across the UK who has made the trip to London for the AGI’s <a href="http://www.agi.org.uk/events/calendar/geocom17">#GeoCom17</a> which is the following day.</p>

<p><strong>Please <a href="https://geomob-october-2017.confetti.events/">sign up on the event page</a></strong> (where you can also see a map to the venue) so we can have a sense of how many people will be attending.</p>

<p>Our format will be the same as ever: after a few very brief announcements we will have six speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory. Then we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our generous sponsors: <a href="https://carto.com">CARTO</a>, <a href="http://what3words.com/">What3Words</a>, <a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data</a>, <a href="https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">KnowWhere Consulting</a>, and <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a>.</p>

<p>Our speakers for the evening will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/spatialarch">John Pouncett</a> - discussing the <a href="https://hillforts.arch.ox.ac.uk/">Atlas of Hillforts of Britain and Ireland</a></li>
  <li>Mojmir Novakovic - presenting <a href="https://kolo.it/">Kolo</a></li>
