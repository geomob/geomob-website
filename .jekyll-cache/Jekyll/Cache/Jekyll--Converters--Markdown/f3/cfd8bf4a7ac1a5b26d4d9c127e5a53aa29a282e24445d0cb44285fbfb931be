I"Ô<div class="heading">When and where?</div>
<p>Our first ever Geomob Lisbon (#geomobLX) will be 
<span class="b">after work (exact time not yet set) on Thursday, the 10th of October </span>
at the headquarters of <a href="https://www.aptoide.com/en/home">Aptoide</a> at (<em><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aptoide,+S.A./@38.744936,-9.1625197,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd19331afdcd244f:0x1c484312630c078f!8m2!3d38.744936!4d-9.160331">R. Soeiro Pereira Gomes Lote 1 3-D, 1600-196 Lisboa, Portugal</a></em>).</p>

<div class="heading">Why?</div>

<p>The goal of Geomob is to provide a forum to learn and exchange ideas about any
interesting services and projects that deal with location. Everyone working in
or curious about the location space or with location services is welcome. You
absolutely do not need to be some sort of GIS expert (though GIS experts are
of course welcome as well).</p>

<p>The talks are a chance to learn, but equally important is the dialogue between
the attendees, which is why I hope everyone can also stay for #geobeers -
generously paid for by our sponsors - at a nearby bar after the talks.</p>

<div class="heading">Agenda</div>

<p>Our format for the evening will be as it always has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>doors open, set up and general mingling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>we begin the talks with a very brief introduction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each speaker will have slides and speak for 10-15 minutes.
After each talk there will be time for 2-3 questions.
Talks will be in English.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We head to a nearby bar for discussion and #geobeers paid for by the sponsors.</p>

</ul>
