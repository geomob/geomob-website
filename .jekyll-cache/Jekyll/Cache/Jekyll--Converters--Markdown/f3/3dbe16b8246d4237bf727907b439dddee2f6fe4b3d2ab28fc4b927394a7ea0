I"ß	<p>Our next #geomob will see us returning to <a href="http://www.bcs.org/">the BCS</a> near Covent Garden (5 Southampton Street) at 18:30 on Wednesday the 7th of September.

<p>As ever, our format for the evening will be a mix of speakers from a broad spectrum of the geo world. Each will present for 10-15 minutes on their topic, then field a few minutes of questions. At the end weâ€™ll quickly vote for the best speaker and award him or her with a <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMap</a> and then adjourn to a neary pub to continue the discussions.Â </p>
