<p>As you can see weâ€™ve expanded from our usual 4 speakers to 6, so weâ€™ll have to keep things moving along. Please arrive on time so we can kick things off on schedule.As always each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to present followed by 2-3 questions from the audience. Please note we are in a different room and building that we have been in in the past, so leave enough time to find it. Thereâ€™s a map over <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/geomob-november/">on the event Lanyrd page</a>.</p>

<p>If you canâ€™t join us on the 22nd we look forward to seeing you at the first #geomob of 2013 which will take place at 18:30 on 7th of February. The British Computer Society has very generously made their facilities near Covent Garden available to us. You can see the <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-february/">speaking and attending list on Lanyrd</a> - please do sign up so we can get an idea of the number to expect.</p>

<p>I close by saying I look forward to geobeers with all of you on the 22nd.</p>
