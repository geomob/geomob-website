<p>Our summer event will take place on the evening of July 14th, I’m delighted to announce we’ll be back in Clerkenwell at the Ordnance Survey’s <a href="https://geovation.uk/hub/">Geovation Hub</a>. It is a great facility and we’re fortunate that they’re once again hosting us. The evening will follow the time-honoured routine: we will have five speakers, each will present to the group for 10-15 minutes then field a few questions from the audience. Afterwards we’ll vote for the best speaker and then head to the pub where the drinks are generously made possible by our sponsors: <a href="https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data</a>, <a href="http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">Knowwhere Consulting</a>, <a href="http://what3words.com/">What3Words</a>, <a href="http://www.igeolise.com/">iGeolise</a>, and <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">Splashmaps</a>.</p>
