<p>The details are now clear for the next #geomob which will take place at 18:30 on Tuesday the 4th of November. Weâ€™ll once again be at the BCS at 5 Southampton Street near Covent Garden, many thanks to them for their continued support. Please <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/geomob-nov/">sign up on Lanyrd</a> so we have a sense of the numbers to expect.</p>

<p>The format will be the same as ever - each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to share their material followed then by 5 minutes of audience questions. At the end of the evening those who wish can keep the discussion going at a nearby pub over #geobeers generously funded by our sponsors (Thank you!).</p>

<p>On the 4th of November weâ€™ll be hearing from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/robhawkes">Robin Hawkes</a> will make his second #geomob appearance talking about his app to automatically determine building height.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/mclduk">Dan Stowell</a> will share his <a href="http://mcld.co.uk/feet-from-a-rat">feet from a rat</a> project</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/gaillyk">Gail Ramster</a> will lift the curtain on <a href="http://greatbritishpublictoiletmap.rca.ac.uk/">the Great British Public Toilet Map</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/zzzviad">Stefano Maggiolo</a> will talk about geography and time</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><span>As always, at the end of the evening attendees will vote by show of hands for the best speaker who will be awarded with a free</span> <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMap</a><span>. The non-winners will have to console themselves with free beer.</span></p>

<p>We hope you agree it has all the makings of a great evening and look forward to seeing you at 18:30 on the 4th.</p>

<p>Many thanks to everyone who attended our event this past week. <a href="https://twitter.com/richardf">Richard Fairhurst</a> took home the SplashMaps best speaker prize for his presentation about cycle routing on <a href="http://cycle.travel/">cycle.travel</a>. Congratulations to him, but also to all of the other speakers for their well received presentations.</p>
