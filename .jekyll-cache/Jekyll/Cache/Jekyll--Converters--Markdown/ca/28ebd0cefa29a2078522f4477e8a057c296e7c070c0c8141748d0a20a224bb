Steven chats with recent FOSS4GUK keynote speaker Mar√≠a Arias de Reyna. Mar√≠a is a senior software engineer at Red Hat. Between 2017 and 2019 she was the President of OSGeo - the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. The conversation is wide ranging discussing Mar√≠a's current work, her recent talk at FOSS4GUK, but also imposter syndrome, and science fiction. Enjoy.
