<p>19:00 BST / 20:00 CEST on Tuesday the 7th of April 2020. This will be
our first ever online event. We have space for about 100 people to watch
the talks. A sign up form will go out in the early-April <a href="https://thegeomob.com/mailing-list">Geomob newsletter</a>, and we will invite people to the live event
based on whoever signed up first. Sorry we donâ€™t have a more fair way to do it.</p>
