<p>After a bit of a summer break our next #geomob will be on Thursday the 
6th of September, at 18:30.
Our good friends at <a href="https://geovation.uk/hub/">Geovation Hub</a>have agreed to host us at their impressive new venue (<em><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.52435/-0.09975">Sutton Yard, 65 Goswell Rd, London EC1V 7EN</a></em>).</p>

<p>While the venue will be new, our tried and tested format will not change: after a few very brief announcements we will have a mix of speakers, each presenting for ten to fifteen minutes and then facing two or three questions. At the end we will vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the <a href="http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers">full list of all past winners</a>).</p>

<p>After the talks we will head to a nearby pub for beers paid for by our 
generous sponsors: 
<a href="https://carto.com">CARTO</a>, 
<a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/startups/">Esri</a>,
<a href="https://flockcover.com">Flock</a>, 
<a href="https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">KnowWhere Consulting</a>,
<a href="https://opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data</a>, 
and <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a>.
Thank you sponsors! The keen eyed among you may notice a few new names in our 
sponsor list, we are very pleased to welcome Esri and Flock as sponsors, more 
about that coming soon.</p>
