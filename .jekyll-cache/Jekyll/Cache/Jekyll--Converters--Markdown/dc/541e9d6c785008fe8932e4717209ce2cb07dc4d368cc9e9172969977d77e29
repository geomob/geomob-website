<div class="heading">When and where?</div>
<p>The first London Geomob of 2020 will be at
<span class="b">18:30 on Wednesday the 8th of January, 2020 </span>
at <a href="https://geovation.uk/hub/">Geovation Hub</a> at (<em><a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.52435/-0.09975">Sutton Yard, 65 Goswell Rd, London EC1V 7EN</a></em>).</p>

<div class="heading">Why?</div>

<p>The goal of Geomob is to provide a forum to learn and exchange ideas about any
interesting services and projects that deal with location. Everyone working in
or curious about the location space or with location services is welcome. You
absolutely do not need to be some sort of GIS expert (though GIS experts are
of course welcome as well).</p>

<p>The talks are a chance to learn, but equally important is the dialogue between
the attendees, which is why I hope everyone can also stay for #geobeers -
generously paid for by our sponsors - at a nearby bar after the talks.</p>

<div class="heading">Agenda</div>

<p>Our format for the evening will be as it always has been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>doors open at 18:00, set up and general mingling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>at 18:30 we begin the talks with a very brief introduction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each speaker will have slides and speak for 10-15 minutes.
After each talk there will be time for 2-3 questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We vote by show of hands for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the <a href="http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers">full list of all past winners</a>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We head to a nearby pub for discussion and #geobeers paid for by the
sponsors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
