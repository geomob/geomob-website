I"†	<p>Fellow geomobbers, I digitally come before you today with good news: weâ€™ve finalized the line up for our first event of 2012 and I believe youâ€™ll agree that we are in for a geotreat (and Iâ€™m not just refering to the post event geobeers).</p>

<p>First of all, let us again thank our gracious hosts, <a href="http://ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>, who have generously allowed us to return. On the evening of Thursday, February the 16th, things will kick off at 18:30 in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.524&amp;mlon=-0.133890&amp;zoom=18&amp;layers=M">G07 in the Chadwick</a>. As at past events weâ€™ll have some signs up on campus directing you. Please arrive on time so we can get started promptly. Also, please register at <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/geomob-february-2/">the event page over on Lanyrd</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, enough organisational chit chat, letâ€™s move on to our lineup for the evening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span class="name">Anna Powell-Smith will discuss her work on</span> <span><a href="http://www.domesdaymap.co.uk/">DomesdayMap</a>.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bertrand Clerc and <span class="gI"><span class="gD">Benedikt Gross will be discussing their work on <a href="http://www.looksgood.de/log/2011/10/mapmap-vauxhall-mashup-mental-maps-and-openstreetmap/">Mashing up OSM and Mental Maps</a>.</span></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ed Freyfogle will discuss <a href="http://blog.nestoria.co.uk/why-and-how-weve-switched-away-from-google-ma">Nestoriaâ€™s recent switch from Google Maps to OSM</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Matt Amos of <a href="http://open.mapquestapi.com/">MapQuest Open</a> will give us a peak behind their tech curtain.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As usual the format will be a very brief intro, then each speaker will present for 10-15 minutes with a few minutes for questions, and the mob will then retire to the <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/66/666/Jeremy_Bentham/Bloomsbury">the Jeremy Bentham</a> for discussion and geobeers graciously subsidised by our sponsor <a href="http://www.lokku.com/">Lokku</a>.</p>

<p>One final note, if you like geomob, you may well be interested in the <a href="http://lccs2.eventbrite.com/">London Citizen Cyberscience Summit</a> also being held at UCL on the 17th and 18th. Please check it out.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing everyone on February 16th.<br />
