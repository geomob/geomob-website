I"-<p>Fellow geomobsters,</p>

<p>I’m delighted to announce our new sponsor <a href="http://www.opencagedata.com">OpenCage Data</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.opencagedata.com" class="center-image"><img src="/images/tumblr_inline_moj66mKlKF1qz4rgp.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>OpenCage helps organisations make use of OpenStreetMap data by providing a simple and affordable data extraction service. In their own words “<span>OpenStreetMap data </span><span>when you want it, in the format you want it”. If you want to avoid the yak-shaving involved in ongoing data extraction give OpenCage a try.</span></p>

<p>This week we’ll be posting the lineup for our next event which will be on 11th of July at 18:30 at Google’s Old Street Campus. Please register on <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-july/">the event page on Lanyrd</a> so we can get a sense of the numbers.  We look forward to seeing everyone there, the post-talk geobeers will be on OpenCage Data and our other sponsor <a href="http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">knowwhere consulting</a>.</p>
