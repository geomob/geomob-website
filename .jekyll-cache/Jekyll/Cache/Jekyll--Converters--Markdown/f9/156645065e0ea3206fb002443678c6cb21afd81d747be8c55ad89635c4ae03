I"ã<p>Fellow geomobsters,</p>

<p>many thanks to all of you who came to the February event, it was our largest turn out yet, the talks were well received and the geobeers were tasty. There are a few photos in the twitter stream (link below).</p>

<p>Post-geomob is of course pre-geomob. Our next event will be Thursday May 18th. We are still finalising the venue details and the speaker list, though the speakers who have already commited ensure that this will be an event not to be missed. As ever, please <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/geomob-may/">sign up on the lanyrd event page</a> so we can get an estimate of attendance. For more details as they emerge please be sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/geomob">follow us on twitter</a>.</p>

<p>If any of our corporate readers would be interested in co-sponsoring along with the the good folks at <a href="http://www.lokku.com">Lokku</a>, please do get in touch.</p>

<p>And on a final note, we are delighted to see the recent news that <a href="http://wherecamp.eu/">WhereCamp EU</a> will be held on 28-29th April in Amsterdam. We encourage all to attend what is certain to be a worthwhile event.</p>

<p>We look forward to announcing more details of our May 17th event in the near future.</p>
