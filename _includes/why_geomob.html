<div class="heading">Why?</div>

The goal of Geomob is to provide a forum to learn and exchange ideas about any
interesting services and projects that deal with location. Everyone working in
or curious about the location space or with location services is welcome. You
absolutely do not need to be some sort of GIS expert (though GIS experts are
of course welcome as well).
