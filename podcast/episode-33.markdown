This episode is a real treat because I had the chance to chat with
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielodonohue/">Daniel O'Donohue</a>,
one of the founders of <a href="">MapScaping</a>. MapScaping is a
retailer of beautiful maps and map socks, but is
probably best known for <a href="https://mapscaping.com/blogs/the-mapscaping-podcast">the MapScaping Podcast</a>, one of the most widely listened to podcasts
in the geospatial world. Daniel shares his
personal story, tells us about making the leap from geospatial consultant to
running his own business, and discusses some of the many things he's learned
through his podcast. The MapScaping podcast was a key inspiration for us in
starting the Geomob podcast. If you are not yet a subscriber to the
MapScaping podcast, I highly recommend it.
