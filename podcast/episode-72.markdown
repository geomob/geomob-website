The global pandemic and ensuing travel restrictions
has increased societal awareness of, and desire to discuss, 
the technical possibilities and implications of collection and use of
location data.


This week our guests are Denise McKenzie and Ben Hawes, two of the organizers
of the recently announced <a href="https://ethicalgeo.org/locus-charter/">Locus Charter</a>,
a proposed set of common international principles to support ethical and
responsible practice when using location data. Denise and Ben talk with Steven
about the motivations of the initiative, who it is aimed at, and how everyone
can get involved.

<div class="pt10">
The project is still in its infancy, but is now gaining momentum, and
seeking discussion, feedback, and collaboration from a broad spectrum of
organizations, small and large, across the location industry.
We encourage all Geomob podcast listeners to learn more about Locus Charter
and Engage in this dialogue.
