Today Ed chats with long-time OpenStreetMap contributor
<a href="https://twitter.com/gregorymarler">Gregory Marler</a> about
the upcoming State of the Map (SotM), the annual OpenStreetMap conference,
which will take place online from July 9-11. 

Gregory is a member of the organizing committee, as he has been for many years.
We discuss the format of this year's event, why someone should attend,
and what attendees can look forward to. We then reminisce about past SotM's,
and speculate about whether we will see a repeat of past geosinging
incidents.

Unfortunately, in the interval since the episode was recorded, tickets to
participate have "sold out". Nevertheless talks will be streamed online and
watchable without registration.

We look forward to seeing you at SotM! Many thanks to all the organizers,
speakers, and sponsors.
