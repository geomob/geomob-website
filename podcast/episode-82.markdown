Today Ed chats with long-time OpenStreetMap contributor Gregory Marler about
the upcoming State of the Map (SotM), the annual OpenStreetMap conference,
which will take place online from July 9-11. 

Gregory is a member of the organizing committee, as he has been for many years.
We discuss the format of this year's event, why someone should attend,
and what attendees can look forward to. We then reminisce about past SotM's,
and speculate about whether we will see a repeat of past geosinging
incidents. 

<div class="pt10">
We look forward to seeing you at SotM! Many thanks to all the organizers,
speakers, and sponsors.
