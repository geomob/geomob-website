One of our regular episodes in which we catch up our projects, and discuss 
the geonews. Ed is a week away from some much-needed holiday, but first 
racing to close out a project for a new large enterprise client at OpenCage.
Meanwhile Steven is back from a week in the country and enjoying having Arnaud 
helping him on Mappery.
<div class="pt10">
We dive into the recent geonews, starting with Lego word maps. The common theme in this month's geonews is that the neogeo scene is growing up: OSM makes it on the Guardian homepage, Mapbox employees form a union, India cracks down on Twitter India showing "incorrect" maps. Finally we discuss the recent article from Joe Morrisson.
