This is one of our regular, shorter episodes in which we (Ed and Steven) catch up on their projects and discuss the geonews.
<div class="pt10">
Over at Mappery the team
has spotted a new map based artist who has left us all saying "wow!". Ed
meanwhile is grappling with the complexities of pricing a new product, and will
soon be ready for beta testers of OpenCage's new geosearch service if anyone
wants to volunteer.
</div>
<div class="pt10">
We start our discussion of geonews by reflecting on
the tragic news of the recent death of Malena Libman, a pillar of the FOSS4G
community, and one of the organizers of FOSS4G 2021. Steven has
written <a href="https://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/blog/malena-libman/">a tribute post on his blog</a>. We offer our condolences to her family, friends, and
the FOSS4G community.
</div>
<div class="pt20">
We then discuss the news that Pixel8, whose founder, Sean Gorman, presented at
Geomob last November, and was a guest on the podcast around the same time,
has been acquired by Snap. Finally, we close with a few musings about border disputes.
