Steven and Ed take a break from interviews to reflect on their own projects,
and Geomob in general. Steven notes that
<a href="https://mappery.org/">Mappery</a> has crossed the milestone of
500 posts! Meanwhile, at OpenCage, Ed and his colleagues are contemplating
the product and
business challenges of geosearch (as opposed to geocoding which they
currently offer). The discussion then moves to a renewed call for Geomob
speakers of any and all backgrounds (you can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDaQz98ef_tMCJmvYjspoTX5Yv8ll-fNHWO4Yk57ZCCDE__g/viewform">volunteer here</a>). Finally, the conversation wraps up with a brief summary of
recent geo industry news including announcements from Google and Microsoft.
