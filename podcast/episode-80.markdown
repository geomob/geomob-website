In this episode Ed speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/ferdinandovilla">Ferdinando Villa</a>, Ikerbasque Professor at the Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3), and lead investigator on the ARIES (AI for Environment & Sustainability) project. The impulse for our conversation was the <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-launches-first-artificial-intelligence-tool-rapid-natural-capital">recent announcement by the UN of a collaboration with BC3 to use ARIES to support countries as they apply the new international standard for natural capital accounting, the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) Ecosystem Accounting</a>. Ferdinando explains what exactly ARIES is, but then our conversation ranges more deeply, reflecting on building models and systems for environmental understanding in a world of where data sets are continually evolving. We then turn to the role that members of the geospatial community can play in encouraging a sustainable future.
