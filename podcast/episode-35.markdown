In this episode Ed chats with Sarah Hoffmann, long time OpenStreetMap contributor, software
developer, and the primary maintainer of Nominatim, the main OpenStreetMap geocoding software.
We go deep on the difficulty of geocoding - especially on top of an every-changing, crowdsourced
data set like OpenStreetMap. Nominatim is immensely powerful, handling about 400 requests per
second as the search on openstreetmap.org. Sarah explains the tech stack, and also the challenges
of managing such a technically complex and publicly visible open-source project.
<div class="pt10">
At OpenCage we rely heavily on Nominatim and are delighted to help support Sarah's work
financially - and of course also with code contributions.
