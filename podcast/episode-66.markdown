This episode's guest is Tim Newman, Product Manager at the Ordnance Survey, where he focuses on the consumer oriented part of the business. Steven and Tim chat about OS Maps, the Ordnance Survey's app for consumers in the outdoors, which recently expanded to cover Australia (and, in an interesting first for OS - makes use of OpenStreetMap data). Finally, they close by discussing geodesy, the science of measuring the Earth's shape.
