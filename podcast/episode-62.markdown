This week we chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/coderholic">Ben Dowling</a>,
founder and CEO of <a href="https://ipinfo.io">IPInfo</a>, a leading
IP-geolocation service. Ed gets into the details with Ben about how they
determine the location of an IP address, how they deal with wrangling
the massive amounts of continually changing data, and advice on
successfully growing an API-based geo business.
