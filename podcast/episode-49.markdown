In this episode Ed has the pleasure of speaking with <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerSRadford">Tyler Radford</a>, executive director of
<a href="https://www.hotosm.org">the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team</a> (HOT). 
We cover a brief history of HOT, and then dive into the current work and scope
of the project. On every metric HOT has grown significantly, and is
now supporting mapping all around the globe. We discuss how new technologies
can help with the goal of growing the map and local OSM communities.
Finally, we cover some ways people can get involved, and then look forward to
HOT's plans for 2021 and beyond.
