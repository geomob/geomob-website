Ed is rejoined by <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexisBatlle">Alexis Battle</a>, CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.avuxi.com/">AVUXI</a>, who we last heard from in <a href="/podcast/episode-8">episode 8 of the podcast</a> which was recorded in February 2020, right before the pandemic started. Alexis shares the details of what life was like inside a travel tech start-up during Covid: how AVUXI lost 90+% of their revenue, shrank the team, fought to survive, pivoted their product offering to also serve the real estate industry, and how they look towards the future.
