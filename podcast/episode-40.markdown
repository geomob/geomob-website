In this episode Steven has the pleasure to chat with Sean Gorman, a veteran of several innovative geo start-ups and now co-founder of <a href="https://www.pixel8.earth/">Pixel8.earth</a>, who are pushing the frontiers of 3D mapping. It is worth your time to check out their site, and see the amazing demo of what is becoming possible when modern cameras and sensors are paired with cutting edge software. This is the state of the art of what is possible in this space. As such it is a pleasure to announce that Sean will be speaking at the Nov 17th Geomob. Enjoy the discussion, and we hope you can also join us at the event.
