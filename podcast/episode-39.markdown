Over the years at Geomob we've seen so many different approaches to and
derivations of London's iconic tube map. In this episode Steven chats with independent graphic designer <a href="https://helenilus.com/">Helen Ilus</a>, who put a new twist on London mapping with her delightful "<a href="https://helenilus.com/greengroundmap/">GreengroundMap</a>", a map of London's green spaces and how best to navigate between them done in the style of the tube map. A fun
conversation that peaks behind the curtain of the design process in which a
cartographic classic is reinterpreted for a fresh use case. Be sure to check
out Helen's site for a look at the map.
