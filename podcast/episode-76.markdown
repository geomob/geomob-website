This episode's conversation focuses on the challenge of marketing in the
geospatial industry. Steve draws upon the expertise of long-time friend
<a href="https://twitter.com/quarryali">Alistair Maclenen</a>, CEO and founder
of geo marketing consultancy Quarry One Eleven. Alistair and Steven reflect
on common geospatial B2B marketing mistakes, but also successes. Alistair
cites What3Words as an example of geospatial marketing success. The discussion
moves on to marketing/positioning advice for geo start-ups, and book
recommendations for further reading. Finally, Alistair appeals for the need
for experimentation in business models in the Earth Observation industry,
including free distribution of data.
