Steven speaks with Arnalie Vicario, Online Community Engagement Lead at HOT.
After several years of volunteering in the OpenStreetMap Philippines community,
Arnalie is the first person to hold the role as Online Community Engagement Lead
at HOT. She and Steven discuss the specific problems HOT is trying to
address with the role, and reflect on the many challenges of making an
inclusive, global community within OpenStreetMap and the wider open mapping
community. The discussion move on to paid mapping, ensuring that the
HOT community contributes responsibly to OSM, and encouraging sustainable,
local mapping communities.
