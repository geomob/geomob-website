This week Ed talks with <a href="https://www.abigail.page">Abigail Page</a>, who is chair of <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/agi-geocommunity-2020-sustainable-revolution-plenary-sessions-tickets-122812588759">GeoCommunity 2020</a>, the annual event of the AGI (the UK's Association for Geographic Information). This year's event will be online from November 16-18th, with the theme of "Sustainable (R)Evolution", and is open to anyone (including attendees from outside the UK) and is completely free to attend. The format is an interesting one, with lots of time and emphasis on mixing and mingling, and we encourage all Geomobsters to attend. Likewise we hope GeoCom20 attendees will find their way to <a href="/post/nov-17th-2020-geomob-details">our Nov 17th Geomob</a>. Abi has a long and diverse history in the geo industry, and is now Head of Innovation & Skills at the UK's Geospatial Commission.
