Steven catches up with old friend <a href="https://twitter.com/geo_will">Will Cadell</a>, CEO of geospatial consultancy Sparkgeo. Will shares stories from
the trenches, giving a perspective on life in a geo consultancy. They also revisit Will's presentation "Creating a geo strategy" presented at last year's FOSS4GUK, with the standout line "It's easy to build something because it's fun. But thinking strategically can turn a fun project into a million-dollar business. We should do more of that." A great conversation about turning geo technology into a geo business.
