With only a few days until Christmas, today on the podcast we're pleased to feature a fantastic example of creative geo thinking being used to help the less fortunate. Ed interviews <a href="https://twitter.com/chrishildrey">Chris Hildrey</a>, founder of <a href="https://www.proxyaddress.co.uk/">ProxyAddress</a>. Originally presented as little more than an idea at Geomob in June 2018 (where Chris won the SplashMaps best speaker prize), ProxyAddress recently launched a first pilot implementation with the London Borough of Lewisham.
