Today's guest is <a href="https://twitter.com/cornish_jack">Jack Cornish</a>,
who works for the Ramblers, the UK's largest walking charity, where he leads
the "<a href="https://dontloseyourway.ramblers.org.uk/">Don't lose your way</a>" project. Jack speaks
with Steven about this effort to support volunteers across 
England and Wales in reclaiming lost paths. Identifying the lost paths is
the start of a long process to put them back on the map as public rights of
way. Over 3,000 volunteers contributed time and effort, and over
49,000 miles (> 78,800 kilometers) of potential rights of way
were "discovered". Jack shares details of what exactly was done and what
the next steps are.
