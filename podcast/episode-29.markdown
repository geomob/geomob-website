As many listeners will know this week is OpenStreetMap's 16th birthday. In 
honor of this milestone I was very pleased to speak with 
<a href="https://twitter.com/allan_mustard">Allan Mustard</a>, chairperson of 
the OpenStreetMap Foundation Board. We discuss Allan's background, his approach 
as a relative newcomer to OSMF, some of the challenges facing the project, and 
possible paths forward.
