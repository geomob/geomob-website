Steven has the chance to speak with freelance artists
<a href="https://twitter.com/DaveDraws_">David Gee</a>, known for his
"Doodle Maps". Doodle maps are hand-drawn, cartoonish, inked illustrations sometimes described as "a caricature of a map". Dave explains the creative process behind the maps, which is about capturing the feel of a city or region in his unique style rather than creating a perfectly geographically accurate representation of a location. Besides standard prints, he also often creates murals. The discussion is an interesting peak behind the curtain of a life of an artist working in the mapping space. I encourage you to explore <a href="https://davedraws.co.uk/">Dave's website</a>, where maps can be purchased as prints, on mugs, masks, etc.
