It's been a long, hot summer. After many weeks of guest interviews, Ed and Steve catch up on their various projects. We discuss OpenStreetMap's 16th birthday, FOSS4GUK, and give updates on our projects Mappery and OpenCage. Amongst much else, Steve laments that previous podcast interviewee Harry Wood leaves nothing for him to map in North London. We hope you are all having a great summer.
