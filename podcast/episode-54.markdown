Steven chats with old friend <a href="https://twitter.com/markiliffe">Mark Iliffe</a>, who works for the United Nations, specifically at UN-GGIM (Global Geospatial Information Management). Mark recounts some interesting memories from his geo career: discusses counting flamingos with image recognition software, humanitarian crowd-sourcing, helping organize FOSS4G Dar es Salaam, and much more, before finally landing at the United Nations, where he "herds geospatial cats".

Mark closes by briefly discussing his own struggles with depression and
encouraging everyone to reach out to others, especially now in times of
lockdown. He asked that we add a link to
<a href="https://www.samaritans.org">the Samaritans</a> a charity working
to help people overcome depression.
