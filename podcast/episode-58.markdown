We catch up with <a href="https://twitter.com/SutchFun">Hana Sutch</a>, co-founder and CEO of walking app <a href="https://www.gojauntly.com">Go Jauntly</a>,
who originally presented at Geomob London back in 2018. Hana shares their
impressive progress since then, and how the app works to guide users to the
best nearby walks. We chat a bit about the many challenges of starting the
business, their business model, the value of perseverance for founders, and
Go Jauntly's plans for international expansion. Finally, she talks a bit about
their experience in the Geovation accelerator.
