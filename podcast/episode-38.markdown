This week we explore the story of
<a href="https://www.splash-maps.com">SplashMaps</a>
with the founders of the business David Overton and Ian Holt.

<div class="pt10">
We discuss the
challenges of running a map printing business in the digital era, and hear
about some of the technology that goes into creating a rugged outdoor map.
This is an interesting case study not just because SlashMaps produce a unique
and high quality geo product, but also to learn the story of how
they succeeded in building their business. SplashMaps
strated originally as a Kickstarter project presented at
Geomob way back in October of 2013. From there the business was up and
running, and now sells a variety of different fabric maps product, be it
rugged maps for wayfinding, masks, or even map printed shower curtains.
For years now Splashmaps have been a key contributor to the Geomob community
by sponsoring the coveted Best Speaker prize awarded by the audience at
each event. Many thanks to David and Ian for their ongoing support!

The holiday season is on the horizon, and I encourage all of you to consider
SplashMaps as a unique and useful gift for any map or outdoor lover you may
know. With the virus putting a damper on exotic overseas travel, more people
than ever will be exploring nature close to home, and a custom SplashMap
centered on your friend or relative's house is a fantastic present.
