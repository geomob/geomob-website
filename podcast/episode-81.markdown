This week's guest is <a href="https://twitter.com/gpsbaby">Neil Ackroyd</a>. He and Steven look back on Neil's long career in mapping and surveying, including the introduction of GPS and the transition to digital processes. He reflects on the many changes to the industry, especially in the context of decades spend in different senior roles at the UK's Ordnance Survey, including two terms as acting Chief Executive. But rather than just looking backwards, the conversation then turns to the topic of "sustainable" mapping and how geospatial technologies and standards can help us create sustainable development. Finally, Steven and Neil also look at the role of national mapping agencies in the age of global mapping giants.
