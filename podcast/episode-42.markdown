Steven catches up with old friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_morley">Jeremy Morley</a>, Chief Geospatial Scientist at the UK's Ordnance Survey. The two first reflect on the evolution of the open geo scene in the UK over the last decade or so (memories that will bring a smile to anyone who fought in the neo v paleo geo wars). The thrust of the conversation is looking back on the OSMGB project in which both were deeply involved. OSMGB was an attempt (together with industry partners like 1spatial to develop an authoritative platform to validate and quality check OpenStreetMap data and thus accelerate adoption of OSM by business and local government. Jeremy and Steve discuss lessons learned, and what the lasting legacy of the effort has been. Finally, Jeremy shares details of and fascinating examples from his current role at the Ordnance Survey, where he heads up their research efforts.
