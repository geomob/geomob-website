We have unfortunately had to cancel
[the GeomobBCN originally scheduled for May 6th](/post/may-6th-2020-geomobbcn-details).
Instead we will have this online event.

<div class="heading">When and where?</div>
19:00 BST / 20:00 CEST on Wednesday the 6th of May 2020.
We have space for about 100 people to watch
the talks. A sign up form will go out in the early-May [Geomob newsletter](https://thegeomob.com/mailing-list), and we will invite people to the live event
based on whoever signed up first. Sorry we don't have a more fair way to do it.

<div class="heading">Agenda / How will it work?</div>

Our format for the evening will be as close to the format of our in-person
events as possible.

* Before the event please make sure you have [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) installed.

* at 18:45 BST / 19:45 CEST we will send an email to the first 100 people on
the sign-up list. The email will contain the URL for logging into the Zoom
meeting. Please do NOT share the URL with anyone, as it means you will
potentially be taking someone else's spot and possibly letting in trouble
makers. That would create a lot of very, very bad geo karma for you, which
would be a pretty heavy burden for you to shoulder. The world has enough
challenges already. 

* When you enter the meeting you will first be in what Zoom calls "the waiting 
room" and a moderator will have to manually approve you. Have patience!
It's a good chance to sample your #geobeer.

* Once in the meeting, attendees will be muted and there will not be a chat.
With 100 attendees it just won't work. If you want to share your opinion
about the event please do so on twitter using the hashtag #geomob.

* at 19:00 BST / 20:00 CEST we begin the talks with a very brief introduction

* Each speaker will present his/her slides, speaking for 10-15 minutes.

* If you have a question for the speaker please send it by email to
questions @ thegeomob.com.

* After the speaker finishes his or her talk a moderator will ask one or two
of the questions submitted by the audience. Hopefully in this way we can have
good quality, concise questions. Sorry if your question doesn't get asked.
Please just follow up one on one (or post it on twitter).

* After the final talk we will vote by twitter poll for the best speaker. The winner will receive a SplashMap and unending glory (see the [full list of all past winners](http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers)). 

* Following the event we will unfortunately NOT be able to head to a pub for
discussion and #geobeers. Feel free to enjoy a #geobeer while watching
the talks. 

* Unless there is some sort of unplanned technical problem, we will post
a recording of the event shortly after the event.
