<div class="heading">When and where?</div>
19:00 BST / 20:00 CEST on Tuesday the 17th of November, 2020.
We have space for about 100 people to watch
the talks. You can [sign up for an invite here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8Nj-M_kjM5mwJRh_-AtQ3yl5q8sxa6yPYn7u1dSZl-2P3ng/viewform)


The zoom link will be sent to everyone who has signed up a few hours before
the event. From 30 minutes before the event we'll start letting people in, and
put attendees in breakout rooms to mix and mingle with others. If you don't
get a spot, please don't despair, we will put the video online shortly
after the event.
