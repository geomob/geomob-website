<div class="heading">When and where?</div>

{% include cancelled.html %}

We will instead [have an online event](/post/may-6th-2020-geomob-details).

<span style="text-decoration:line-through">The next #geomobBCN will be at
18:00 on Wednesday, the 6th of May, 2020.
I am delighted that we can once again rely on the hospitality of our friends at
[CoWorkIdea](https://coworkidea.com/en/), who will host us at their
excellent co-working space at [Carrer de Torres i Amat, 21, First Floor](https://goo.gl/maps/wEAX4uRU8EN2)</span>.
