<p>The next #geomob will be at 18:30 on Tuesday the 19th of September,  we’ll be back at <a href="http://thetrampery.com/workspaces/traveltech-lab/">Traveltech Lab</a> by Tower Bridge, specifically at <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.505232602357864&amp;mlon=-0.08056014776229858#map=17/51.50523/-0.08056">6th Floor, 2 More London Riverside, London SE1 2RR</a>. </p>

<p>Please sign up <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2017/geomob-september/">on the Lanyrd page</a> so we have a sense of the numbers to expect. </p>

<p>The format is the same as always. Five speakers, each will have 10-15 minutes to present and then a few minutes for questions. At the end we will vote to determine the coveted <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMaps</a> best speaker prize. Then we will head to a nearby pub for discussion and geobeers. All of that is made possibly by the generosity of our sponsors, who you should immediately support </p>
