<p>Friends,</p>

<p>I am delighted to announce that <a href="https://carto.com/">CARTO</a> has become a #geomob sponsor!</p>

<p>CARTO is the platform for turning location data into business outcomes.</p>

<p>Their tools make it simple for anyone - especially those without a deep GIS background - to understand geodata, be it for analysis or to tell a story. Their products are used by thousands of customers around the world, from multinationals to start-ups.</p>

<p>Here’s a screenshot:</p>

<p>This is an exciting development not just because CARTO is a great geo brand, building amazing tools, but also because they first presented at #geomob back in September of 2012. Since then the business has grown significantly, with offices in the UK, Spain, Estonia, and the US (East and West Coast). It is a great #geomob success story. They are <a href="https://carto.com/careers/">hiring for numerous roles</a>. You can learn more about CARTO and their products <a href="https://carto.com">on their site</a>, or by <a href="https://twitter.com/CARTO">following @CARTO</a> on twitter.</p>
