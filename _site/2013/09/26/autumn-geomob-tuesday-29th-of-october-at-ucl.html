<p>Geomobsters,</p>

<p>With maptember winding down, some of you might be ready for a geobreak. But the pace of geoinnovation remains relentless: there is no rest for the weary.</p>

<p>I’m pleased to announce our lineup for the Tuesday, October 29th #geomob. As always we will kick off at 18:30, we’re very thankful to our good friends at UCL for once again making a lecture room available. This time well be in Malet Place Engineering room 1.02, for a detailed map, please <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-oct/">see the Lanyrd page</a> (where you should also please sign up so we can get a sense of the number of geoenthusiasts to expect). Please arrive on time so we can kick things off promptly. </p>

<p>We’re fortunate to have six great speakers lined up for the event:</p>

<ul>
