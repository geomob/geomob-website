<p>Fellow geomobbsters, </p>

<p><span>The pace of geoinnovation remains relentless and as such we turn our attention to our next event. At 18:30 on Thursday the 25th of April we’ll be back at UCL, this time  in the Chadwick Lecture Theatre (in Basement of the Chadwick building - we’ll post signs). </span></p>

<p><span>As always many thanks to UCL for hosting us, and to our sponsors who make the whole thing possible. So that we can get a handle on numbers please <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob/">sign up on the Lanyrd page for the event</a>, where you can also find a map.</span></p>

<p><span>Our speaker line up is looking very good, <strike>nevertheless we may be able to squeeze in one more</strike>.
