<p>Fellow geomobsters,</p>

<p>I’m pleased to announce a great lineup for this summer’s event which will be held at 18:30 on Thursday the 11th of July. We’re very thankful to Google for once again hosting us at their <a href="http://www.campuslondon.com/">Old Street Campus</a>. We’re lucky to have five great speakers this time so we’ll try to kick off promptly. Please be on time.</p>

</ul>

<p>Many thanks to all the speakers.</p>

<p>As per long standing #geomob tradition the talks will be followed by a visit to a local pub where the geobeers will generously be provided by sponsors <a href="http://www.opencagedata.com/">OpenCage Data</a> and <a href="http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">knowwhere consulting</a>. </p>
