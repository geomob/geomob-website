<p>Hail fellow geomobsters, </p>

<p>many thanks to everyone who made it to our July event, especially the speakers, our hosts Google, and the sponsors. Several of the speakers have posted their slides, you can find links in the <a href="https://twitter.com/geomob">geomob twitter stream</a>. </p>

<p><span>As announced there, our next event will be 18:30 Tuesday the 29th of October at UCL. Many thanks to them (particularly <a href="http://povesham.wordpress.com/about/">Muki Haklay</a>) for again making their facilities available to us. The exact room will be announced in a few weeks.</span></p>

<p><span>Please</span> <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-oct/">sign up on the lanyrd page</a> <span>if you can make it so we can get an idea of the numbers. You’ll see that we already have one speaker confirmed. We’re currently recruiting a few others, but always remain open to suggestions. Please let us know who in the world of geo you think is doing something worth talking about.</span></p>

<p><span>Some of you will be raising your hands in despair that it is almost four months between #geomobs. Fear not, September (rechristened as <a href="http://www.maptember.org/">Maptember</a>) holds more than enough alternative geo events in the UK. </span><span>We look forward to seeing many loyal geomobsters there. </span></p>

<p><span>Enjoy the summer!</span></p>
