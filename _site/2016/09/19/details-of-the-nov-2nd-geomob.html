<p>Many thanks to one and all that came to <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/148317905840/back-at-the-bcs-for-the-7th-sept-geomob">our September event</a>. The next #geomob will be 18:30 on Wednesday the 2nd of November. The good folks at <a href="http://www.bcs.org/">the BCS</a> have once again agreed to host us in their facilities at 5 Southampton Street, near Covent Garden. <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-november/">Please sign up on lanyrd</a> so we can have an idea of the numbers. </p>

<p>We have a great lineup set for the evening. As always each speaker will have 10-15 minutes to explain their project, then field a few questions from the audience. At the end we’ll vote for the best speaker and head to a nearby pub for #geobeers generously paid for by our generous sponsors.</p>
