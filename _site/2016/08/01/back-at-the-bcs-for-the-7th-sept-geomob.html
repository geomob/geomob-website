<p>Our next #geomob will see us returning to <a href="http://www.bcs.org/">the BCS</a> near Covent Garden (5 Southampton Street) at 18:30 on Wednesday the 7th of September. Many thanks to them for once again generously hosting us at their excellent facilities. <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/geomob-september/">Please sign up on the lanyrd page</a> so we can estimate numbers, you’ll also find a map to the venue on that page. </p>

<p>As ever, our format for the evening will be a mix of speakers from a broad spectrum of the geo world. Each will present for 10-15 minutes on their topic, then field a few minutes of questions. At the end we’ll quickly vote for the best speaker and award him or her with a <a href="http://www.splash-maps.com/">SplashMap</a> and then adjourn to a neary pub to continue the discussions. </p>
