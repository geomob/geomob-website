<p>Nice work everyone, this week’s #geomob at Campus was our biggest yet, this shot captures only about half the audience. </p>

<p>My thanks to all six of our speakers. <a href="https://twitter.com/geoviews">Benjamin Hennig</a> has posted an <a href="http://www.viewsoftheworld.net/?p=3978">overview of his talk</a>. As the other speakers make their slides public we will tweet the URLs from <a href="https://twitter.com/geomob">the geomob account</a> (which you all no doubt follow).</p>

<p>The quality of the talks over the course of the evening was a testament to the wide variety of geo-innovation happening in and around London. Against tough competition <a href="https://twitter.com/jasondavies">Jason Davies</a> was able to win the crowd over with his talk about D3 and thus became the first winner of the coveted best speaker prize: <a href="http://www.splashmaps.net/shop/make-map/">a custom SplashMap</a>. Well done Jason! We look forward to carrying on the best speaker SplashMap tradition at all future #geomobs. Here’s a picture of SplashMaps CEO (and former two-time #geomob speaker!) <a href="https://twitter.com/dbyhundred">David Overton</a> congratulating Jason on his victory. </p>
