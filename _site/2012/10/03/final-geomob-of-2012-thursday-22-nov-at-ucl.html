<p>Geomobbers,</p>

<p>many thanks to speakers, attendees, and our hosts, Google, for another good <a href="http://geomobldn.org/line-up-of-20-sept-geomob">#geomob a few weeks back</a>. Such is the relentless pace of innovation in the location based services space though, that we don’t have time to dwell on past events, we turn our attention to the future.</p>

<p>Our Q4 event will be taking place on Thursday the<abbr></abbr> 22nd of November at 6:30pm. Our good friends at UCL have been gracious enough to host us once again, for which we’re very grateful. This time we’ll be in the Roberts Building, room 508. As always, <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2012/geomob-november/">please sign up on Lanyrd</a> so we can get an idea of numbers. As per long standing geomob tradition we will afterwards retire to the Jeremy Bentham pub. I’m very pleased to announce that the November event features the arrival of a new sponsor. Along with <a href="http://www.lokku.com/">Lokku</a>, this event’s geobeers will be co-sponsored by <a href="http://knowwhereconsulting.co.uk/">knowwhere consulting</a>! A few of the speakers are already commited, but if you or your organisation would like to speak, please get in touch. We will be closing out the list shortly.</p>

<p>If you can’t bear the thought of waiting until November to get your geofix, fear not. On Wednesday 24th of October Google’s Old Street Campus will be hosting the all day <a href="http://www.w3gconf.com/">W3G 2012 Conference</a>. The theme of “Is Open the New Black” will know doubt appeal to many geomobbers and we hope to see you all there.</p>

<p>Finally, for those of you ready to write off 2012 and turn your attentions to the green pastures of 2013, we’ve already set the date (and first speaker) of the Q1 #geomob. On <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2013/geomob-february/">Thursday the 7th of February</a> we’ll return to the BCS near Covent Garden.</p>

<p>Yours in geolove,</p>

<p>the #geomob team</p>
