<p>Great news geomobbers, <a href="http://what3words.com/">what3words</a> is joining us as a sponsor!</p>

<p>For those that don’t know what3words is a new, simpler way to communicate location. In true #geomob spirit what3words is not only an innovative geo idea trying to change the world, but also it was invented in London.</p>

<p>Most pleasing for me is that the business has made the transition from #geomob speaker to sponsor: CEO and founder Chris Sheldrick was one of our speakers last May (<a href="http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers">you can see all past</a> <a href="http://geomobldn.org/past-speakers">speakers here</a>).</p>

<p>The company has come a long way since then, and recently relaunched <a href="http://what3words.com/">their website</a>, which I ecourage you all to check out. Perhaps equally relevant to the #geomob audience is that they also much improved <a href="http://developer.what3words.com/">their developer resources</a>. Anyone wishing to learn more should follow <a href="https://twitter.com/what3words">@wha3words</a> on twitter or <a href="http://vimeo.com/112227335">check out their introductory video</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome what3words and many thanks! Many thanks also to all of our sponsors who make the post-event beers possible. As I often comment I think the post-talk discussion is often as valuable and stimulating as the speakers, and I encourage all of you to do your best to join in at our next #geomob on <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/108481526085/details-of-the-march-19th-geomob">the 19th of March</a>.</p>

<p>Until then,</p>
