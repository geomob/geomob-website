<p>Fellow geomobsters,</p>

<p>I hope the summer is treating you all well. </p>

<p>Our next event will take place on the evening of the 30th of September. As always we’ll kick off at 18:30, and likewise we shall stick to our time honored formula: 5-6 speakers from across the gamut of those doing interesting things in London in geo.</p>

<p>We’ll be back at UCL in the Pearson Lecture Theatre, there is a map <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2015/geomob-september/">on the Lanyrd page for the event</a> (please sign up so we can get a sense of the numbers). I’d like to explicitly thank longtime friend of #geomob <a href="https://twitter.com/mhaklay">Muki Hakley</a> Professor of Geographical Information Science at UCL for once again making their facilities available to us. It is only through such generosity that #geomob is possible. Muki you are ace!</p>

<p>I am pleased to announce our speakers for the evening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/GarethJWood">Gareth Wood</a> of <a href="http://www.fullermaps.com/">Fuller Maps</a> will show off some of his hand drawn map work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/JonnyBritton">Jonny Britton</a>, co-founder of <a href="http://www.landinsight.io/">LandInsight</a> will tell us about their work. </p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/abdulrshahid">Abdul Shahid</a> will report on some of his research into crowd sourced mapping. </li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/charliedavi">Charlie Davies</a> of <a href="http://www.igeolise.com/">iGeolise</a> will share what they are up to</li>
  <li><a href="http://marquisdegeek.com/">Steven Goodwin</a> will tell us about his “Flight Composer” hack</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/TomTheMap">Tom Timms</a> will close things out by taking a bit about one of the projects he works on at the <a href="http://www.geoinformationgroup.co.uk/">GeoInformation Group</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Following the talks we will, as always, vote for the SplashMaps best speaker and then head to a nearby pub where the drinks will be paid for by our sponsors. Please check our their services and let the world know how great they are.</p>

<p>As one example of many of how great our sponsors are, and as an added incentive to join us on the 30th, <a href="http://geomobldn.org/post/122756697890/thanks-esri-uk-for-becoming-a-geomob-sponsor">our new sponsor Esri UK</a> will be raffling off a beautiful book on map design to all attendees in what we hope to make a new #geomob tradition.</p>

<p>One final point, for those who can’t wait until the 30th of September to get their geo fix, keep in mind that <a href="http://geohackdays.com/">GeoHackDay</a> is happening on the 5th of September. </p>

<p>See you on the 30th of September at UCL,</p>
