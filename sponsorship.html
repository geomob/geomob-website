<h3>Become a Geomob sponsor</h3>
      

Geomob is made possible by our generous hosts and sponsors.

<div class="p20">
If your brand
would like to help foster geoinnovation in one of the cities we are active in
<a href="mailto:geomob@opencagedata.com">please get in touch</a>.
Sponsoring Geomob is a very low-effort, highly affordable way to reach the
location based service developer community. Sponsorship costs are:
</div>

<div class="p10">

  <ul>
    <li class="gli"> London: &pound;150 for a single event or &pound;600 for an annual package (5 events).
    <li class="gli"> Barcelona: &euro;150 for a single event or &euro;600 for an annual package (5 events).      
  </ul>
</div>

<p/>Sponsors receive:
<ul>
  <li class="gli">logo and link on the Geomob website</li>
  
  <li class="gli">branding at the event in the form of a logo in the intro presentation</li>
  
  <li class="gli">a mention on <a href="https://twitter.com/geomob">our twitter account</a> before each event</li>
  
  <li class="gli">a dedicated post on the site at the start of the sponsorship (annual package only)</li>

    we have 50-75 attendees.</li>

  <li class="gli">a mention and link in our month newsletter</li>
  
  <li class="gli">good geokarma</li>
  
  <li class="gli">we welcome all ideas for deeper partnership that fit the #geomob ethos.

  </li>
  
</ul>

<div class="p10">
The sponsorship funds are used exclusively to pay for the post-event pub
visits where attendees discuss the ideas and start-ups presented. If this is
of interest to your brand please email geomob @ opencagedata.com. We look
forward to hearing from you.
